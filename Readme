This is my first game... if you can call it that at this point.

The world randomly generates and you can move around using the WASD or arrow keys, m brings up a minimap.

Future version will randomly generate monsters, loot and and exit.

The goal of the game is to have a player load into a random level and then have the choice to sneak by or 
fight the monsters to get their loot and the levels tresure chest. Each level has an exit which goes to another level.

there will be levels and health and item and it will be a regular rougelike party blowout.

The graphics right now are very temporary. The player, tree and bush are from pokemon. The boulder and wall are from dcss, 
which for the time being (meaning while I'm still playing around and figuring stuff out) most will probably come from there from now on.
